            <p><b>Report bugs</b><br />

        <li>
            <p><b>Reproduce bugs and verify fixes</b><br />

        <li>
            <p><b>Create new RFCs</b><br />

            <p><b>Participate in development IRC channel and Area51</b><br />
            phpBB's development is public. When developers want to discuss something, have a question or want to request feedback they do it either in the development IRC channel (<a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/phpbb-dev" title="Connect to #phpbb-dev">#phpbb-dev on FreeNode</a>) or on the Development Discussion Board. Everyone is welcome to participate in these discussions to whatever extent they want.</p>
